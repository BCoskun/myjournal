== Hi there

this project is just a filestore about my ideas, notes, etc... that I can use from anywhere.

I'm a senior infrastructure architect, so I'm interrested in various IT things:

* how to efficienly write architecture documents
** after years with visio, word and powerpoint, it's time to move to 'doc as code'.
** i'm using right now
*** asciidoc (markdown is too limited)
*** plantuml
*** gitlab on premises for work
*** github when playing at home
* how to improve continuous deployment
** hashicorp tools
** kube
** dcos ?
* how to improve day 2 ops
* new software
