== Hi there

this project is just a filestore about my ideas, notes, etc... that I can use from anywhere.

I'm a senior infrastructure architect, so I'm interrested in various IT things.

At the moment my hot topics are:

* how to efficienly write architecture documents
** after years with visio, word and powerpoint, it's time to move to 'doc as code'.
** i'm using right now
*** asciidoc (markdown is too limited)
*** plantuml
*** gitlab on premises for work
*** github when playing at home
* how to improve day 2 ops in a world where all the hype  is about ci/cd
** hashicorp tools
** kube
** dcos ?
* how to influence management in a way that improve both company efficiency and people wellbeing
** the toyota way
*** lean management is just a tool, lets focus on the spirit
*** *develop people*
*** *continuous improvment*
* new software
* new methods
